# These tests drive the real manager rather than reimplementing its lock behavior.
# Recording subprocess mocks are used only to count actual signal dispatches.
# A repeated stop request must not send a second SIGINT to a flushing writer.
# The direct-download test holds the file-lifetime context open on a worker thread.
# Shutdown must wait until that context is released by the worker.
# An explicit event proves the closer cannot finish before the file has closed.
# Both worker and closer joins are followed by liveness assertions.
# A process creation test starts a real child while holding the shared condition.
# The concurrent shutdown must observe that child once the launch lock is released.
# The child runs no network requests and receives the manager's real stop signal.
# Test-local managers keep their stopping state separate from the recorder singleton.
# The process-creation failure case proves stopping blocks future disk writes.
# An explicit second shutdown verifies completed shutdown is idempotent.
