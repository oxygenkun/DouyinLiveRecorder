# The imported signing implementation must match the old deployed source exactly.
# Its deterministic output is verified using a frozen clock and synthetic request data.
# The signature golden was computed from the untouched ihmily local-source implementation.
# SM3 reference digests were independently checked with OpenSSL through hashlib.new('sm3').
# Literal vectors keep these tests portable to Python builds without OpenSSL SM3 support.
# Empty, short and full-block inputs exercise the hash padding boundaries.
# No authenticated cookies or actual account URLs are used by these tests.
# A local module time shim prevents the frozen clock from affecting pytest or logging.
# Exercising the complete signer also covers the custom alphabet and RC4 packing steps.
# The signature is a compatibility fixture, not a production request or a reusable credential.
