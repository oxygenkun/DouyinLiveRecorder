# This fixture is intended for a disposable process or container, never production output.
# The driver sets SHUTDOWN_TEST_OUTPUT to its own temporary directory.
# It imports the real main module, including the production signal handler.
# All network checks are disabled; inputs are FFmpeg's synthetic testsrc2 frames.
# Two concurrent recordings cover normal and segmented MP4 trailer finalization.
# The segmented path uses the same fragment options as the production builder.
# Readiness is published only after both child processes are registered and alive.
# The parent driver then sends SIGTERM to this Python process.
# FFmpeg children run in new sessions, preventing inherited duplicate stop signals.
# Success requires every output file to pass ffprobe and complete ffmpeg decoding.
# The fixture waits indefinitely only so the parent can test real signal delivery.
# All generated video and log files are removed by the driver's temporary context.
# Disposable harness using the actual recorder and signal handler, with synthetic video only.
